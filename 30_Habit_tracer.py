"strftime" function is used to formate the dates any any required formate. However,  We need to use the official 
documents inorder to get the code of getting the exact word of abbreviation to use. 
for eg:- %Y is used to get the year 
         %m is used to get the month in digit 
         %d is used to get the present date of the month.
